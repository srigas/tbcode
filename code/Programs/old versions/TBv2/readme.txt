This file explains the structure of config.txt.

The first three rows correspond to the lattice vectors a_1, a_2 and a_3 and the input form is

X,X,X
X,X,X
X,X,X


The fourth row corresponds to the number of reciprocal space wavevectors in each direction, i.e. N_kx, N_ky, N_kz in the form

X,X,X


The fifth row corresponds to the maximum length R_max, the sixth row corresponds to the characteristic interaction length r_0 and the seventh row corresponds to the on-site energy r_0 in the form

Finally, the eigth row corresponds to the number of neighouring cells that are taken into account for the calculation of the RLATT vectors in the form
